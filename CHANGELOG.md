## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 04/28/2020

### Added

- Reload command and reload button in view's title bar - The extension could get into a situation where a file exists in a working set but not in the file system (e.g. switching between git branches). This command allows the user to reload so the tree view is up to date.

## [1.0.0] - 04/20/2020

- Initial release
